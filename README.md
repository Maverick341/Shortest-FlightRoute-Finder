# Shortest Flight Route Finder

This web application is designed to find the shortest flight route between two airports. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path in a graph representation of airport connections. The project includes both client-side and server-side components, with the server written in Node.js and SQLite used as the database for storing airport and route information.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to enhance the project in the following ways:

- **Improved Visualization**: Implement a graphical representation of the flight network alongside the shortest path for better understanding.
  
- **Integration with Google Maps API**: Replace the graphical representation with an actual map using the Google Maps API. This will provide users with a more interactive and real-world view of the flight routes.
